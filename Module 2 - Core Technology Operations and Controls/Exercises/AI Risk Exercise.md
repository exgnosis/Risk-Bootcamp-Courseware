# AI Risk Exercise

### Logistics

**Due date is Wed Nov 5.**

**This will be part of your final assessment**

- One page writeup
- Due at the EOD Nov 5
- One minute oral summary on Nov 5

## Part 1: Business Risk
- The LLM industry is in volatile state with some analysts suggesting that the industry is in an unsustainable bubble.
- As well, the costs of developing AI models are escalating with increased demand for power, water and other resources that can't keep up with the projected future demand by AI data centers.
- The other factor of concern is the vulnerability of the supply chain for the computer chips that are used in the AI industry.

### Step 1.1
- Do an online search for current analysis of the state of the AI LLM industry.
- Consider both sides of the discussion
- For example;
  - [Federal Reserve says no AI bubble](https://www.pcmag.com/news/fed-chair-jerome-powell-ai-bubble-why-its-different-90s-dotcom-era)
  - [AI Bubble Debate](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/news/the-ai-bubble-debate-13-business-leaders-from-sam-altman-to-bill-gates-to-mark-cuban-weigh-in/ss-AA1PC9k2)
  - Find other similar articles to base your analysis on.
- In addition, look for supply chain and other related issues like
  - [The AI Chips Supply Chain Incredible Fragility](https://medium.com/@gaetanlion/the-ai-chips-supply-chain-incredible-fragility-6d6a7197b3c5)  
  - [AI to drive 165% increase in data center power demand by 2030](https://www.goldmansachs.com/insights/articles/ai-to-drive-165-increase-in-data-center-power-demand-by-2030)

### Step 1.2
- The FinCen bank is considering making LLM based AI tools part of its critical operational infrastructure. 
- The primary argument being considered is that as other banks start to incorporate LLM based AI tools, FinCen will find itself at a competitive disadvantage that could lead to a critical reduction in market share.
- Prepare an executive summary on the risks of both options: developing LLM based AI tools and the alternative of not developing them
- Remember to keep this discussion confined to business and operational risk, not IT risk.
- Your written presentation should be 1 page maximum
  - Remember this is an executive summary

## Part 2
- The bank has decided to implement a chatbot application for customer online banking help, which will handle ALL online queries and problem resolution.
- Consider the AI chatbot as consisting of three IT components
  - The LLM model used to generate replies
  - The user interface
  - The database module that translates the request made to the chatbot by customers into database updates in the system of record.

### Step 2.1
- Do a high level Business Impact Analysis on potential business operations disruptions that outages in the chatbot application could cause
  - **You do not have to submit your BIA, but you need to do it to prepare for the second step**

### Step 2.2
- Based on the BIA you did, develop a high level business continuity plan by designing a resilience strategy to responds to failures in the chatbot application
- The written submission should be no more that half a page.
- The oral presentation should be no longer than one minute.
